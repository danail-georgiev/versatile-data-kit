# VDK Shared Components library

This project implements common UI functionality that is used in the data-pipelines project.
Everything in this folder is project agnostic and there is nothing data-pipelines specific about them.
The hope with having them in a separate directory is that other projects might leverage them.

## Running

Shared UI Components library is build and delivered as an Angular Library that is consumable via
the NPMJS repository.
See the `README.md` files in individual directories under `projects` for specific instructions.
