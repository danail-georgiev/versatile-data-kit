# Setup environment for AMLD workshop

Here are scripts that preapre the backend enviornment to be used in AMLD workshop

The entry point is the setup-env.sh script.
It will
- Install Pipelins Control Service
- Install trino with mysql as backend catalog

Aside from that because my binder allows connections only on port 80 or 443 (and a few more: https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/blob/master/mybinder/values.yaml#L46)
we use API gateway to expose those :

https://us-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/develop/auth/attach?api=iaclqhm5xk&integration=qbji9io&region=us-west-1&routeKey=&routes=taal8qu&stage=$default

1. Go to API Gateway -> Click Create API -> Follow instructions
2. Then make sure to set in routes configuration . "$default" so that all paths are proxied
